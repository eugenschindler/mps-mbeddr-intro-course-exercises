mps-mbeddr-intro-course-exercises
=================================

This set of projects will open in JetBrains MPS 2023.3.

Exercises for DSL-ifying a C program with mbeddr, also adding a self-made language abstraction

Note: StartingPoint has an empty model. This is not a mistake, but actually meant for people to fill with an mbeddr C module. Step 1 is the result of executing the exercise from StartingPoint. Step 2 is the result of executing the exercise with Step 1 as a starting point, etc.

Please check build.gradle or one of the respective .mps/migration.xml files for the version of MPS to which models have been updated.
