The starting point is the plain text C file in this directory. The first assignment is to create an MPS project with an MPS solution in it and inside the solution an MPS model with an "mbeddr C module" root node inside it. This root node must be populated with mbeddr C code manually, based on the plain text C file in this directory (in other words: type manually the C code from the plain text file into the mbeddr C module in MPS).
